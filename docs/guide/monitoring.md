## Monitoring an Experiment

At any point in time you can see the status of your running experiments by issuing the `riseml status` command:

```
$ riseml status
ID     PROJECT    STATE    AGE           TYPE
138    ai-toaster RUNNING  2 second(s)   Experiment
```

You can continue streaming the logs with the `riseml logs` command:

```
$ riseml logs 138
138       | [2017-08-30T09:36:11Z] --> FINISHED
138.train | [2017-08-30T09:36:11Z] --> FINISHED
138.build | [2017-08-30T09:36:11Z] --> FINISHED
138.build | [2017-08-30T09:21:53Z] Building your image
138.build | [2017-08-30T09:21:53Z] Downloading code
...
138.train | [2017-08-30T09:26:20Z] Successfully downloaded inception-2015-12-05.tgz
...
```
This will output the last known states followed by a chronological stream of the produced output.

In addition, you can obtain real-time statistics about CPU utilization with the `riseml monitor` command:

```
$ riseml monitor 138
ID        PROJECT     STATE      CPU       MEM        GPU    GPU MEM
138.train ai-toaster  ‚óè RUNNING  1.1/4 |2  2.0/60 |4  -      -
```

The syntax for CPU and MEM statistics shows `current/available |requested`.
In the example, **1.1** CPUs are used and the host has a total of **4** CPUs available.
As per the job definition, you have requested and are guaranteed at least **2** cpus.
