## Experiment States

An experiment follows the following state model.
It starts in _Created_ and ends in _Killed_, _Failed_ or _Finished_ states. A typical experiment runs through five states:
_Created_, _Building_, _Starting_, _Running_, _Finished_.
In case there is a cached build available for an experiment the _Building_ state is skipped.
