# Welcome to RiseML

RiseML simplifies running, tracking, and scaling deep learning experiments on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) clusters.

Kubernetes is an open-source system for orchestrating and scheduling containerized workloads that was initiated by Google.
RiseML adds support for Machine Learning workloads and frameworks like Tensorflow.
With RiseML, you can easily track experiments, run distributed learning experiments across multiple nodes, and perform hyperparameter optimization.

## Getting Started

Run and track your first experiment using the [Quick Start](quick_start.md) guide.

To learn how to install and manage a RiseML cluster, follow the [installation instructions](install/index.md).

After installation, you can learn how to [run and track experiments](guide/preparation.md).

Additionally, we provide a reference on [experiments](reference/experiments/config.md) and their configuration, the [runtime environment](/reference/environment.md) and [CLI flags](/reference/cli.md).
